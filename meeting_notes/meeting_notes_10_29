Todo for next checkpoint (1 week from today)
___________________________

TA: Josh Nelson, Thursday 4:15 PM
Setup github repo
Using the tracking tool of choice (github projects) to setup a backlog of work, broken into tasks that take 3-4 hours, leading from start to finish. These can be updated and revised throughout the entirety of the project.
Plan the first sprint
Assign tasks to people for the first sprint
Recommended: Spike tasks as part of the sprint
  1-2 hour long tasks
    example: draw a smiley face with ffmpeg as a .png
    The idea is so you know how to interface with a a part of the system for future troubleshooting
Plan regularly scheduled standups. Everyone should be there, everyone must share:
  What they're working on
  What they're stuck with
  What they're doing next
  Suggested one standup per sprint
  Each person gets about 1-2 minutes for this
The timescale of the minute of output data is up to you
  it could be as much as 48 hours compressed into a minute
  another group using 1/day covid data was "pushing it", so probably try not to go lower frequency than that for more than one data source
  Grabbing the most recent data point from a slow updating source would be fine
  The most ideal would be to have data that updates on the scale of hours rather than days
Data seeding: ask the professor
We don't have to use the exact same time slot, but we should try and get the same TA
