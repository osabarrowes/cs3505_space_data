We would like to use lambda statements

Ted demonstrated completed work on the text-to-image task. Due to power outages, sample output was not available.
Some supernovae data points occur with identical timestamps, which conflicts with the requirement that files be named after the unix time at which the data point occurred. We discussed and corrected this by having the script overwrite data points with identical times, so that only the last read data point is actually saved persistently.
Corbin is still working on parts of the text-to-image task.

When and how often should we start collecting data?
  Supernovae: once per day
  Other data sources: about once every 30 minutes
  Start: ASAP
Where should docker files be stored?

Tasks for next week:
Scheduled automatic data collection via lambda statements - Marley and Ted
Ask Prof. Jensen about meeting next week - Edward
UML class and sequence diagrams - Edward
Current framebuilder program is hardcoded, and needs to be generalized to take arbitrary time ranges - Ivan and Garrett
Ongoing work on
An output video
