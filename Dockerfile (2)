# This image will be based on the ubuntu image.  Build it using the
# command in the comment below.  You may omit the ubuntu pull if you already
# did it.  Before running the build, change into the directory containing
# this Dockerfile.
#
# docker pull ubuntu
# docker build --tag myubuntu  .
# 
# (Don't forget the trailing . to specify that this directory is the context.)

FROM ubuntu

# Set a default shell.

# The timezone library stops the docker build and waits for user input to
# select a timezone. This breaks the build. To get around this, 
# set up timezone information prior to installing that library. This
# Docker code does that. Composited from two sources:

# Install a handful of useful libraries.  Note that this is generally against
# best practices -- containers should be lean, and not include 'things you
# might use'.  In our case, we're using the containers for development, so
# this may be reasonable here.
